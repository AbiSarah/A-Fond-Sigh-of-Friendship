## About the Collection

Friendship albums are something you may have not heard of; or have a different idea of what it may have been, when you hear the name. A friendship album,  may also be known as an amicorum album, or in the case of my family, autograph books. These were albums where people would have a combination of artwork, poems, literature, autograph, imagery, and collages, etc. The friendship album is made up of passages from different people, who may have been friends, family, or even someone new. Friendship albums were not a purely Western construct, it was global, and from our research dates back to the 1500s. The items that are in this exhibit are from Brock Archives & Special Collections and also from my family's reservatory.
