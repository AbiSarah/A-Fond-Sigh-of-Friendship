## About the Collection

Friendship albums are something you may have not heard of; or have a different idea of what it may have been, when you hear the name. A friendship album,  may also be known as an amicorum album, or in the case of my family, autograph books. These were albums where people would have a combination of artwork, poems, literature, autograph, imagery, and collages, etc. The friendship album is made up of passages from different people, who may have been friends, family, or even someone new. Friendship albums were not a purely Western construct, it was global, and from our research dates back to the 1500s. The items that are in this exhibit are from Brock Archives & Special Collections and also from my family's reservatory.
Friendship albums were a great way of leaving memories, especially during a time where there wasn’t social media and many people  may not have had easy access to a camera. People could go travelling, meeting new people, and they could collaborate, adding these albums. 
Ann Eliza Hepburne Rooth, the prior owner of the Friendship album currently in Brock's reservatory, has the lovely demonstration of different types of imagery and literature spattered throughout her friendship album. This album is important to the history of Niagara, because she was born in Chippewa and Ann and her husband William, lived in different locations in the Niagara region throughout her life; which can be presumed that she brought her album with her. It also seems that she continued this book throughout her entire life as well, dating back to 1837 to a couple years before her death, 1897. This would explain why there are very dark sections of the album, one even talking about the death of a child; only one excerpt is included under the name of 'In Memoriam'. 
Ann’s album can give us a glimpse into not only her history, her journey, but also a peek into niagara's history or visual culture; like what kinds of artists or writers were in there, even the unfamous, are still significant.
