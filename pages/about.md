## About the Collection

Friendship albums are something you may have not heard of; or have a different idea of what it may have been, when you hear the name. A friendship album,  may also be known as an amicorum album, or in the case of my family, autograph books. These were albums where people would have a combination of artwork, poems, literature, autograph, imagery, and collages, etc. The friendship album is made up of passages from different people, who may have been friends, family, or even someone new. Friendship albums were not a purely Western construct, it was global, and from our research dates back to the 1500s.(1) The items that are in this exhibit are from Brock Archives & Special Collections and also from my family's reservatory.

The second page of Ann Eliza Hepburne Rooth’s Friendship album, has a poem that describes this book very well:

''Dear book, wherein I often view the faces of the loved and true, with whom I've wiled sweet hours away, and held sweet converse by the way. 
Where are the friends whose silent forms, enclosed are within thy bonds, have they all gone - I left to mourn? And wander on life's way alone. 
Yes, some to heavenly homes have gone, their work on earth is finished and well done, and some are travelling yet in life's rough way. And hope bespeaks for all a happy meeting day. 
Dear Album! of no intrinsic worth art thou, that I so fondly o'er thee bend, it is fond memory that gives back the sigh, [for] each beloved, departed friend once nigh.''(2)

Friendship albums were a great way of leaving memories, especially during a time where there wasn’t social media and many people  may not have had easy access to a camera. People could go travelling, meeting new people, and they could collaborate, adding these albums.(3) 

Ann Eliza Hepburne Rooth, the prior owner of the Friendship album currently in Brock's reservatory, has the lovely demonstration of different types of imagery and literature spattered throughout her friendship album. This album is important to the history of Niagara, because she was born in Chippewa and Ann and her husband William, lived in different locations in the Niagara region throughout her life; which can be presumed that she brought her album with her. It also seems that she continued this book throughout her entire life as well, dating back to 1837 to a couple years before her death, 1897.(4) This would explain why there are very dark sections of the album, one even talking about the death of a child; only one excerpt is included under the name of 'In Memoriam'. 

Ann’s album can give us a glimpse into not only her history, her journey, but also a peek into niagara's history or visual culture; like what kinds of artists or writers were in there, even the unfamous, are still significant. 

For the images added from my family's Repository who mostly resided in Chippewa from the 20th century; this is to add context and the trends of items in these albums. One album is my great-grandmother Mildred Hill's and my Grandma Frances Stitt Leeder's. Stitt with her last name, at the time when the book was made. 

When looking through these friendship albums a connection can be made between the ones from the 20th century and the one in the 19th century. There are drawings, poetry, meaningful words from friends or family. Jokes that can be found in these albums too. These albums are a look into the history of Niagara, the types of people that lived there, and yes some of the entries in Ann's book weren't all from Niagara. It can also be used as an example of how someone from Niagara may have interacted with people of different cultures.

Having the extra two examples of friendship albums can show us the differences between the culture of Niagara in the 19th century versus the 20th. The writing style is different. The cursive is looser in the 20th century and Tighter and much harder to read from the 19th, but even then we see a difference from the 1920s and 1930s in writing styles. It shows us how the culture has changed overtime and the pattern of speech and dialect. The album from the 19th century holds a lot of Old English while the 20th century examples show us a much more Modern way of speaking, even in the 20's and 30's.

Ann Eliza Hepburne Rooth's album tells a continuous story of her life. This exhibition is only showing a few examples of such gifts from friends or families or new Folk; some may even be entries of her own, which wasn't uncommon.(5) It can give us a glimpse into what some of the culture was like in Niagara in the 19th century, and with contrast with the 20th century albums, showing the difference and similarities between the two centuries.
